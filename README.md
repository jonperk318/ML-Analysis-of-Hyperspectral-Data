# ML-Analysis-of-Hyperspectral-Data

Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) machine learning architectures to analyze spatial and spectral features of hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy images taken from hybrid inorganic-organic perovskite nanoscale materials

The following code was written in Python 3.9.13 in an Anaconda environment.
