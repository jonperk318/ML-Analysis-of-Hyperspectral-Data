# Machine Learning Analysis of Hyperspectral Data

Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) machine learning models to analyze 
spatial and spectral features of hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy images taken from hybrid 
inorganic-organic perovskite materials on the nanometer scale.

## Installation and Usage

**The .h5py hyperspectral datasets are not publicly available at this time as they have not yet been published. 
However, when they are published, they will be included in this repository.**

The Jupyter Notebooks in this project require Python version 3.12.2 or later.

Create a new virtual environment and clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/jonperk318/machine-learning-analysis-of-hyperspectral-data`. 
Open the cloned directory and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This contains necessary Jupyter core 
packages as well as all other packages, including numpy, scikit-learn, pytorch, and pyroved. Then, run `jupyter notebook` 
and navigate to the notebook you wish to view.
